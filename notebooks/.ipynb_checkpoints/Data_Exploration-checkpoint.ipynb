Cab drivers can be picked up stochastically, but there are also many fixed appointments that existed before hand. Given a bunch of hotels, and times we want to predict the amount of cabs that will arrive to a hotel for a time interval, separated into time buckets. \n",

Lets represent that space as a weighted graph G = (V,E) where some edge e in E corresponds to a road in the real world, and v represents connections between two roads.
